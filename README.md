# racing-library

This project provides a Spring Boot REST API and WebSocket designed to simulate a dynamic drone racing experience. The REST API enables users to configure race parameters, access drone and track data, and retrieve race results. Meanwhile, the WebSocket supports real-time event streaming, allowing users to receive instant updates on race progress or drone positions.
